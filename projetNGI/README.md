Machine Learning Driver Fingerprinting using GM's SDK

Utilizing data gathered from GM vehicle sensors we create a platform to analyze driving data sent to an offboard server running on Wolfram Cloud. This driving data is analyzed using machine learning algorithms we developed to accurately determine who is driving the vehicle based on their driving patterns. The driver is then shown a driving score at the end of their drive based on their acceleration, braking, and quick turns during the drive. Having a vehicle that can determine the driver based on previous drives allows the vehicle to make decisions on driver experience autonomously. If the vehicle can determine who is driving the car, the driver doesn't have to worry about climate control, seat position, mirror position, favorite music stations, or any other personal settings within the vehicle. Having a car that knows who is driving the car without user input allows a seamless driver experience from the start of the engine, to the close of the garage on return.
